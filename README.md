# Bamazon

The purpose of this project was to create an Amazon-like app bot using Node JS and MySQL. The app displays a list of products and prompts a user to select a product they would like to purchase and the quantity. Afterwards the app displays the total price of the product. If the desired quantity is not in stock, the app will display that information as well.
